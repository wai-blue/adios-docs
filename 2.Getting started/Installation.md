Before you start the installation of your ADIOS project, ensure that your local machine has PHP and Composer installed.

Once you have installed PHP and Composer, you can proceed with the following steps to begin your journey with ADIOS:

1. Navigate to the desired location where you want to create or save your project.
2. Use the following commands to create your first CRM application:

For linux:

```
composer create-project wai-blue/adios-app
cd adios-app
./bin/build.sh
```

For windows:

```
composer create-project wai-blue/adios-app
cd adios-app
cd bin

```
