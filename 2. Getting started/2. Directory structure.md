# Directory structure

ADIOS application's root folder looks like this:

```
log/                 // app's log
upload/              // where your uploaded files are stored
src/                 // all source code of your application
  Widgets/           // app's widgets
    Customers/       // this is a widget
      Actions/       // implementation of controllers ("actions") of the widget
      Exceptions/    // custom exceptions of your widget
      Models/        // definition of models in the widget
      Templates/     // TWIG templates for the controllers
      Main.php       // "main" class of the widget
  Assets/            // all assets used in your app
    images/
    css/
   js/
  ConfigApp.php      // default configuration of your app
ConfigEnv.php        // environment-specific configuration of your app
```  

There are many in-built features like **routing** that respect this folder structure. This means that you do not have to routers if you do not need a very complex application. You just need to respect this folder structure.
