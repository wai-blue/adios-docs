# ADIOS documentation - SiteForge

SiteForge is a tool designed to streamline the process of creating static page documentation. It enables to quickly generate documentation from markdown files stored on GitHub. By automating the conversion of markdown content into a static website, SiteForge helps to speedup the documentation creation process, saving valuable time and effort.

Using this tool, we can bring you ADIOS documentation in two versions, now it's on you, which option you use:

<<<<<<< HEAD

## Using SiteForge

Before you start, ensure that your local machine has PHP installed.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Next, clone the [adios-docs repository](https://github.com/wai-blue/adios-docs) to your desired location. To generate the documentation, open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost/Docs/Static/SiteForge/index.php
```

Navigate to one of the three functionalities available in SiteForge:

1. [Static page builder](#Static page builder)
2. [Link checker](#Link checker)
3. [Generate numbered documentation structure](#Generate numbered documentation structure)

### Static page builder

The script will automatically generate a new version of the index.html file based on the content of the Documentation folder. Each chapter of the documentation is represented by a folder, and each file within the folder corresponds to an individual article within that chapter.

Before doing so, consider removing the previous version of index.html along with the associated resources folder. There could be some files in the existing resources folder that are no longer needed.

### Link checker
