# ADIOS documentation - SiteForge

SiteForge is a tool designed to streamline the process of creating static page documentation. It enables to quickly generate documentation from markdown files stored on GitHub. By automating the conversion of markdown content into a static website, SiteForge helps to speedup the documentation creation process, saving valuable time and effort.

Using this tool, we can bring you ADIOS documentation in two versions, now it's on you, which option you use:

1. [Static website for browsing all markdown files in one place](https://wai-blue.github.io/adios-docs/)
2. [adios-docs repository content is ready for you to browse markdown files on your own](https://github.com/wai-blue/adios-docs)

## Using SiteForge

Before you start, ensure that your local machine has PHP installed.

Next, clone the [adios-docs repository](https://github.com/wai-blue/adios-docs) to your desired location. TTo generate the documentation, open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost/Docs/Static/SiteForge/welcome.php
```

The script will automatically generate a new version of the index.html file based on the content of the Documentation folder. Each chapter of the documentation is represented by a folder, and each file within the folder corresponds to an individual article within that chapter.
