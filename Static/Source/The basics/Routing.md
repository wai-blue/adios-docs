# Routing Introduction

Routing plays a crucial role in the ADIOS framework, enabling the mapping of incoming requests to appropriate handlers and resources. This section provides an introduction to routing and guides you throuht in your ADIOS applications.

## What is Routing?

Routing is the mechanism that determines how an incoming request is handled and which code or resources should be invoked to process that request. In the context of ADIOS, routing allows you to define the structure and behavior of your application's endpoints, making it possible to handle various HTTP methods, route parameters, and URL patterns.
