# Introduction to ADIOS Framework

Welcome to the official documentation of ADIOS, a powerful framework designed to simplify the development of robust CRM applications.

## Introduction

Whether you are a seasoned developer or just starting your programming journey, ADIOS empowers you to create complex applications with ease.

Throughout this documentation, you will explore various aspects of ADIOS, including its architecture, core concepts, and key features. We will delve into best practices, provide code examples, and guide you through the process of harnessing the full potential of ADIOS to build applications.

## What is ADIOS?

ADIOS is a lightweight rapid application development framework based on the MVC architecture, designed to simplify the development of robust CRM applications. It stands on the concept of being a framework with a small footprint, prioritizing efficiency, performance, and speed as key features. With only a little coding, you can create application with complete CRUD functionality, containing complex inputs such as dates, WYSIWYG editors, or autocomplete, and able to manage complex data structures.

One of the notable advantages of ADIOS is the elimination of router configuration. By simply creating a file, the routing table updates automatically.

ADIOS provides built-in UI components for CRUD operations, removing the need for importing additional components. UI/Table and UI/Form components are are in-built.

Thanks to the powerful form templating engine in ADIOS you can easily create complex forms. Whether it's tabs, grids, inputs, or dashboards, you can achieve them with just a few lines of code.

You have free hands over customization of your application.
