# Sample simple CRM app

The examples used in this documentation are taken from a sample CRM application.

To run the application, you need to:

  1. download the source code [here](../2.%20Getting%20started)
  2. extract the downloaded file to a root folder of your webserver
  3. create the empty database for your application
